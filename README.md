# Sorting Visualization Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Sorting Visualization Project! This project is a graphical representation of basic sorting algorithms, designed to help users understand and visualize how different sorting techniques work. Developed by Group 2 for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course in the 2023.1 semester at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, this project aims to provide an educational tool for students and enthusiasts alike.

## Features
- **Visual Representation**: Watch as the sorting algorithms dynamically sort arrays of numbers.
- **Algorithms Included**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Radix Sort
- **User Interaction**: Control the speed of the visualization and select different algorithms to see their behavior in real-time.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students learning about sorting algorithms and their performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java-supported IDE)
- **Libraries**: Swing, awt for graphical user interface and many orther 

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sorting-visualization.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd sorting-visualization
    ```
3. **Open the Project in Your IDE**:
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred Java IDE).
    - Import the project by selecting the `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` file (depending on your build tool).

4. **Build the Project**: 
    - Ensure all dependencies are installed.
    - Build the project using your IDE's build tools.

5. **Run the Application**:
    - Locate the main class file `App.java`.
    - Run the application to start the visualization.

## Usage
- **Select Algorithm**: Choose from the dropdown menu to select a sorting algorithm.
- **Spawn Capacity**: Type the number elements of array.
- **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider to control the speed of the visualization.
- **Start/Stop**: Click the 'Start' button to begin the visualization and 'Stop' to pause it.
